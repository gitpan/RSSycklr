Revision history for RSSycklr

0.03    20080804
        - Updated half-done 0.02 entry date below. Sigh.
        - Fixed synopsis.t output a little.
        - Put timeout on XML::Feed->parse() requests.
        - Updated docs a bit and though load_config will still handle
          a Perl structure, it's not in the doc now and won't do it
          much longer.
        - Considering name change to App::RSSycklr... Not sure.

        - Improved Pod for 'rssycklr.' Didn't mean to ship it with
          such bad docs.

0.01    20080803
        - Holy cats is Mouse/Moose hot. This is an adaptation of a
          script I've been using. It's the kind of thing that normally
          seems wrong for a module but Mouse made it natural. Really
          nice. See the docs for todo and such.
